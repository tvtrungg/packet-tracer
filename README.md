# Packet Tracer

## Overview
The project encompasses network design and configuration tasks, divided into two main sections:

### Routing and Network Configuration:

- Analyzing routing methods and creating logical network topologies.
- Using Packet Tracer for network simulation, configuring IP addresses, and implementing routing on network devices.
- Verifying connectivity among network devices for proper functionality.
- 
### Office Network Setup:
- Designing a network for a new office with specific requirements based on floor divisions and user needs.
- Implementing DHCP, DNS resolution, and a web service within the internal network domain.
- Detailing device descriptions, locations, IP assignments, and functionalities.
- Deploying the designed network using Packet Tracer and validating its operational status via commands like ping, nslookup, ipconfig, and web browsing.

The tasks involve logical network mapping, device configuration, and service implementation, focusing on network structure, IP assignment, and ensuring seamless connectivity within the office environment.
